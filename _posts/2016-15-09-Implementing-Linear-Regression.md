# When to use linear regression

# What are we Implementing
-> using simple example to understand the underlying principle
-> octave focus on the Math
-> using one variable

# Dataset
-> split between training and test data

# Feature Selection
-> for now just one variable

# Plotting the data
-> what are we looking for
-> show simple model vs overfitted model

# Math for a straight linear
-> y = mx + t
-> Hypothesis
-> Why choosing this one not a higher order polynomial

# Basics covered
## Cost Function
-> purpose of cost function
-> overfitting if it's everytime 0
## Gradient Descent
-> purpose of gradient descent 
-> What is a Gradient (no calculus required)?

## Model definition
-> What is a model, vector with values that helps us make predictions
-> Theta

# Fitting the data
-> Show each iteration

# Result

# Using the test  data
