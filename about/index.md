### Who am I?
I'm Armin and currently I'm studying computer science at the [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/) in Munich, and I'm working at a startup called [TadoÂ°](https://www.tado.com/de-en/) working mainly with JavaScript.

### What's the goal of this blog?
I've created this blog for a really egoistic reason, I want to write down the things that I'm learning or reading in order to remember them maybe somebody else will find it useful.
I'm going to write about software development.

### What am I going to write about?
I'm going to write summaries on the technical book that I'm reading maybe.
I'm also excited about Angular 2, so I'm probably going to write about it. And in
 generally I'm interested in JavaScript ecosystem (Node, ES2015), so I'm probably going to write
 about it.
